        <h1>3A Homework List & Reminders</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            This website is an archive of all homework lists and reminders, from
            the 3A WhatsApp group (except 02/09, which was posted on the
            informal Google Classroom), as well as a list of all homework.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            All lists are sorted chronologically and according to month. Below
            is a list of months, where you can click on it to jump to the page
            of that particular month, which shows a “calendar” of the entire
            month, with all the dates* being clickable to jump to the
            list/reminder of that particular date.
